| `/sbin`       | Contains executable files, utilities, and system commands that are reserved for the root user or a user with root privileges.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `/usr`        | One of the most important directories due to the enormous amount of data it holds. The directory contains system-wide read-only files. These include libraries, user binaries and their documentation, programs, and system utilities.                                                                   |
| `/proc`       | Somewhat of a strange directory. It is a virtual filesystem that contains vital information about running processes. It is considered the control and information center for the Linux kernel. The filesystem is created on the fly upon system startup and is destroyed once the system is powered off. |
| `/mnt`        | Along with its subdirectories is a directory intended to be used as a temporary mount point for [mounting storage devices](https://www.tecmint.com/how-to-mount-and-unmount-an-iso-image-in-linux/ "Mount and Unmount an ISO Image in Linux") such as Hard disk drives, USB drives, and CDROMs.          |
| `/sys`        | A virtual file system that contains a set of virtual files that provide an interface to the Linux kernel.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `/media`      | A directory where the system mounts removable media such as USB drives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `/run`        | Temporary filesystem that contains volatile runtime data that shows the system has since it was booted. Files under the **/run** directory must be deleted (removed or truncated as convenient) at the start of the boot process.                                                                        |
| `/tmp`        | Stores temporary files and many programs use this directory to create lock files and keep the temporary storage of data. Many of the files under this directory are critical for presently running programs and removing them may affect a system crash.                                                 |
| `/lib`        | Stores all standard essential standard libraries required by user binaries in `/bin` directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `/lost+found` | Installed during the installation of Linux, useful for recovering files that may be broken due to unexpected shut-down.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `/srv`        | Service directory and is abbreviated as `srv`. This directory contains server-specific and service-related files.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Terminology
### Spool Files:
A spooled file holds output data until it can be printed. The spooled file collects data from a device until a program or device is able to process the data. A program uses a spooled file as if it were reading from or writing to an actual device.
