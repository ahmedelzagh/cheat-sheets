# Next.js

Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building server-rendered or statically exported React-based web applications. It was created to make the process of building scalable and performance-optimized web applications easier and more straightforward.

Next.js provides a lot of the infrastructure needed to build a web application, including:
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and pre-rendering
- Automatic code splitting and optimized production builds
- Routing and handling of dynamic pages
- A simple file-based API for getting data into your pages and components

Some of the key benefits of using Next.js include:
- Improved performance and SEO for your web applications
- A faster development experience, thanks to features like hot code reloading and automatic optimization of your builds
- A wide range of plugins and integrations, making it easy to add additional functionality to your applications
- A thriving and active community, with a wealth of resources and support available

Next.js is a popular choice for developers building both small and large-scale web applications, and is used by many well-known companies such as Netflix, Uber, and GitHub.
