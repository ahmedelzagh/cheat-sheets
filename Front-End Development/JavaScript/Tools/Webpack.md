Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It takes in a bunch of different assets, such as JavaScript files, CSS, images, etc., and creates a single bundle file that can be included in a web page. The goal of webpack is to optimize the delivery of those assets to the browser, by minimizing the number of HTTP requests, compressing the assets, and transforming the code to make it more efficient for the browser to process.

Webpack uses a configuration file, often named `webpack.config.js`, that specifies the input and output of the bundle, as well as any other processing that needs to be done to the assets before they're bundled. For example, the configuration file can specify the use of loaders, which are plugins that transform the source code into a format that webpack can understand and bundle. Some common use cases of loaders are transforming TypeScript into JavaScript, or transforming Sass into CSS.

```js
# Syntax:

const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html'
    })
  ]
};
```

In addition to bundling assets, webpack also offers features such as code splitting, which allows you to split your code into smaller chunks that can be loaded as needed, and hot module replacement (HMR), which allows you to make changes to your code and see the updates in the browser without having to reload the page.

Overall, webpack is a powerful tool for optimizing the delivery of assets in modern JavaScript applications and is widely used in front-end development.
